# RollerCoaster

A simple Roller Coaster simulation made for the graphics coursework for my masters.

The simulation has a rollercoaster which moves on the track using Catmull Rom Spline.

The speed of the roller coaster can be changed. This project also has lighting techniques and various advanced rendering techniques.
